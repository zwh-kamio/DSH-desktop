/**
 * The Node-compatibility table, in one place. Two consumers share it, and they
 * must resolve to the same module instances:
 *   - the worker vite build aliases these specifiers for code bundled statically
 *     into the worker (vendored loader, Connection, …);
 *   - the worker module loader answers `require('node:fs')` from VFS-loaded
 *     modules out of this table, before bare-name resolution.
 * Anything absent here fails loudly at resolution instead of resolving to an
 * empty module. `process` is deliberately absent: the worker host installs that
 * global itself and fills it into this table at assembly time.
 *
 * Import paths carry the classification: `./implemented/<module>.ts` backs the
 * module's real semantics over a worker data source, while `./mock/<module>.ts`
 * is a structural placeholder whose calls report the missing capability. File
 * names match their Node module specifiers exactly, nesting included.
 *
 * Every value is a {@link StaticModuleFactory}, so the loader reads a table
 * entry only when a `require` names that specifier. What a factory defers is the
 * table read, not module evaluation: each one answers a namespace object of the
 * static ESM graph below, which the worker bundle evaluates at load like any
 * other import. Deferring a shim's own start-up cost therefore belongs inside
 * that shim, on the path that first needs it.
