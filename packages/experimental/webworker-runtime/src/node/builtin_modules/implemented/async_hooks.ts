/**
 * `node:async_hooks` for the worker: `AsyncLocalStorage` over an EXPLICIT-SWITCH
 * model with two fallbacks. A browser has no async-context tracking, so the store
 * a read answers is decided by three slots, in this order:
 *
 * 1. HOOK OVERLAY — set for the duration of one callback by the hook layer
 *    (`./async-context-hooks.ts`), which captures the context where a callback was
 *    REGISTERED (`.then`, `queueMicrotask`, timers, `fetch`) and restores it where
 *    the callback RUNS.
 * 2. RESUMED CONTEXT — the explicit-switch slot. {@link __snapshotAll} copies every
 *    live instance's effective store and {@link __restoreAll} publishes a copy; the
 *    module loader's `await` rewriting pauses with the first and resumes with the
 *    second, which is what makes attribution causally correct across an `await`
 *    even while another chain interleaves. The rewriter's `restore` returns nothing,
 *    so this slot holds ONE value per instance and a resume REPLACES it rather than
 *    stacking: a frame that resumes again at its next await re-publishes its own
 *    context anyway, and a new `run()` boundary shadows the slot for its extent.
 *    (Callers that want scoping get a disposer back from {@link __restoreAll}.)
 * 2b. BOUNDARY AMBIENT — `run()` also publishes its own store here, so rewritten and
 *    un-rewritten code agree on what the innermost boundary is.
 * 3. FOLDING STACK — the fallback for code the rewriter has not touched: `run()`
 *    pushes an entry that is removed synchronously for a synchronous operation, or
 *    when the returned promise settles for an asynchronous one, so a store stays
 *    visible across `await` inside that operation.
 *
 * Every slot is removed by IDENTITY, never blindly: boundaries settle and frames
 * resume out of order, so a blind pop would drop somebody else's context — and a
 * slot that is released while shadowed must leave the chain without promoting
 * itself back over whoever came after it. The three slots are separate for the same reason — a restored
 * copy pushed onto the folding stack could unwind another boundary's entry.
 *
 * A snapshot with no stores at all is `undefined`, and the hook layer then wraps
 * nothing: a callback registered outside every boundary keeps inheriting the
 * enclosing boundary rather than being masked to `undefined`. `__snapshotAll` is
 * the transformer-facing counterpart and always captures every instance, including
 * the ones reading `undefined`, because a resumed frame must see exactly what it
 * saw at its pause point.
 *
 * BOUNDARY (structural, documented rather than worked around): native
 * `async`/`await` resumption inside code the rewriter has NOT transformed is
 * invisible to user code. Such a frame falls back to the folding stack, which is
 * ordered by nesting rather than by causal chain, so two boundaries overlapping
 * there can attribute to the wrong one. Nothing crashes, the stacks still unwind by
 * identity, and everything the hook layer or the rewriter covers is exact.
