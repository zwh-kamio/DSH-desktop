# api/ — Remote API layers

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `api/` group provides the application's Remote layer: a Client environment can call the business capabilities running on the Host — manage goals, run commands, list the plugin inventory, discover file and session references — as typed method calls, and receive the results or forwarded Host events. `remotes` decides which capabilities are exposed and how each call reaches the right session's agent; `gateway` carries the calls and their results between Client and Host. The stack runs over the application's shared Connection; streaming session data is deliberately outside it.

## Packages

The packages below provide the Remote layer; the package READMEs own the exhaustive contracts.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`remotes/`](remotes/README.md) | Chooses which Host capabilities and events the Client can consume. | — |
| [`gateway/`](gateway/README.md) | Carries typed unary calls, multiplexed streams, and forwarded Host events. | `ctx.typertGateway` / `ctx.remote` |
| [`session-controller/`](session-controller/README.md) | Owns Session commands, history streams, live control state, and Agent/Session identity policy. | `ctx.sessionController` / `ctx.remote.session` |
| [`settings-controller/`](settings-controller/README.md) | Owns the configuration-surface reads and writes over the settings-domain seams. | `ctx.settingsController`, `ctx.credentialsController` / `ctx.remote.settings`, `ctx.remote.credentials` |
| [`workspace-controller/`](workspace-controller/README.md) | Owns Workspace mutations and the complete Client Workspace projection. | `ctx.workspaceController` / `ctx.remote.workspace` |

Remote calls run Client → Host over the application's shared Connection. API Gateway owns Remote transport, while the controller packages own Session, configuration-surface, and Workspace behavior. Feature packages register exact Connection Fetch routes for responses that do not fit Remote invocation, such as streamed downloads.
