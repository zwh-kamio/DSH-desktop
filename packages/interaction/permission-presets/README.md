English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-permission-presets` gives a deployment one user-facing Permissions selector that bundles two independent enforcement knobs — the sandbox mode and the approval policy — into named presets. Selecting a preset applies the sandbox mode and approval policy together, while each knob keeps its own value, so sandbox execution, approval, prompt narration, and replay each read their own setting. The default table ships `workspace-write` (workspace-write + ask) and `danger-full-access` (danger-full-access + never); a knob combination matching no preset reads back as the derived `custom`, which clients may display but never select. The service also owns the `permission` settings namespace whose default applies only when a later session is created, and two optional children — a `permissions` session projection and the `/permission` command — expose the same surface to the Web client. Mounting it requires a confining bash executor and the approval service; it owns no enforcement itself.

## Use this package

Choose this service when a deployment wants to offer users one Permissions selector instead of separate sandbox and approval controls. It bundles the knobs; execution and approval keep their own values, so removing the package later leaves the last selection in effect.

### Configuring presets

The plugin config defines the preset table and the default for fresh sessions. Each preset name bundles one sandbox mode with one approval policy; `name` and `description` are optional client presentation.

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-permission-presets'
  config:
    presets:
      workspace-write:
        sandbox: workspace-write
        approval: ask
      danger-full-access:
        sandbox: danger-full-access
        approval: never
    defaultPreset: workspace-write
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `presets` | `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access` | Table of preset name → sandbox/approval bundle |
| `defaultPreset` | inferred | Preset pinned into fresh sessions; required when composition defaults match no preset |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-permission-presets) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc. The name `custom` is reserved for the derived not-a-preset state and cannot name a table entry. Mounting requires a confining bash executor (one that reports a `sandboxMode`) and the approval service.

### Switching presets

Switching to a preset changes only the knobs whose effective value differs; selecting the preset already in effect changes nothing. The current value resolves as the still-matching last recorded selection, else the first matching table entry, else `custom`. Users switch through the `/permission` command: a bare invocation reports the current preset and the available table, and a preset argument switches to it.

### What users see

Clients render the select with every switchable preset in table order, plus `custom` shown exactly while it is current. `custom` is display-only — callers can switch away from an unmatched knob combination but cannot select or persist a named custom preset through this service.

### Session defaults

The `permission` settings namespace holds `defaultPreset` for future sessions: session creation reads it, applies it to the sandbox mode and approval policy, and records the applied preset as a `permission/preset` selection. Later settings changes never alter an existing session. A resumed seed, including an explicitly empty one marked by `session/end-seed`, preserves its effective permission and receives only missing durable facts rather than the latest user default.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The observable behavior is covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package); this section explains the write path, the read side, and the optional children.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | `PermissionPresetService`: preset table, write path, settings namespace, session pinning, children |
| [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) | `permissions` projection-key declaration and select payload types |
| [`src/invariant.ts`](src/invariant.ts) | Invariant companion validating that `permission/preset` names a resolvable preset |

### Write path

`apply()` resolves the preset, appends `permission/preset` only when the effective preset changes, then writes each changed knob through its canonical setter — `setSandboxMode` from `dsh-sandbox-policy` and `setApprovalPolicy` from `dsh-user-approval`. The selection event precedes the knob events so user intent survives when two presets share a bundle; a net-zero selection appends nothing.

### Read side and `custom`

`current(session)` reads the `permissions` projection, whose unit folds the three whole-value knob events over the composition defaults (`ctx.shell.sandboxMode` and the approval config). The host state also retains whether `session/end-seed` has occurred, so session pinning distinguishes an explicitly empty restored seed from a genuinely fresh session without rescanning the log. A still-matching last selection wins shared-bundle ties; otherwise the first table match wins; otherwise the derived `CUSTOM_PRESET` is returned. A missing registry or projection key fails explicitly.

### Session pinning and blank reuse

Mounting pins every live and future session: a genuinely fresh session gains the default preset and both knob facts, while seeded or partially initialized sessions keep their effective knob values and gain only missing durable facts. The projection-owned seed marker makes this decision from the same incremental state as the knob values.

### Optional children

The `permissions` projection unit registers only when a `ctx.sessionProjections` registry is composed; the `/permission` command registers only when a `ctx.commands` registry is composed. Calls that derive the current preset or pin an initial selection require the projection and fail explicitly without its registry or key.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through `dsh-user-approval` and `dsh-tool-bash`, which render the approval-policy prompt, switch notice, and sandboxed tool outcomes selected by this service's knob events; `permission/preset` itself is log-only.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct invalidation; the named consumer owns any request-prefix changes.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define what the preset service does not offer. They are current package constraints, not a permission-system comparison.

- **Only two mechanism knobs are bundled** — presets select sandbox mode and approval policy; an agent/profile choice is not part of `PresetSpec` yet.
- **`custom` is derived-only** — callers can switch away from an unmatched knob combination but cannot target or persist a named custom preset through this service.
- **The preset table is process-level** — configuration is fixed for the plugin lifetime; changing available presets requires reloading the plugin.
- **Stored defaults must remain in the preset table** — removing the referenced preset makes Permission settings registration fail until the `permission` section in `settings.yaml` is updated or reset.
