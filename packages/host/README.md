# host/ — web-GUI host half

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `host/` group provides the web GUI's plain HTTP server, the SPA dist server that serves the built Web shell, the workspace-directory picking seam with its native, browse, and adaptive composition packages, and the read-only plugin inventory projection. All seven packages are product packages; the browser transport lives in [`client/`](../client/README.md), and the composed application is [`apps/cli`](../../apps/cli/README.md) booting the [`dsh-base` bundle](../bundle/base/cordis.patch.yml) that serves the web app under `apps/web/`. The picker backends replace one another behind the shared seam.

## Packages

Seven packages play the host roles; each package README owns its contract and configuration.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`webserver/`](webserver/README.md) | Browser HTTP server: named routes, upgrades, index taps, and the fallback seat | `ctx.webServer` |
| [`frontend-static/`](frontend-static/README.md) | SPA dist server on the webserver fallback seat | consumes `ctx.webServer` |
| [`directory-picker/`](directory-picker/README.md) | Workspace-directory picking seam: capability contract and error vocabulary | `ctx.directoryPicker` |
| [`directory-picker-native/`](directory-picker-native/README.md) | Native-OS-chooser backend for operators at the host display | registers `ctx.directoryPicker` |
| [`directory-picker-browse/`](directory-picker-browse/README.md) | In-app directory-browser backend, including for remote clients | registers `ctx.directoryPicker` |
| [`directory-picker-auto/`](directory-picker-auto/README.md) | Host-adaptive chooser that mounts the matching backend at boot | mounts a backend |
| [`plugin-inventory/`](plugin-inventory/README.md) | Read-only projection of current Loader entries | Remote `pluginInventory/list` |
