# attachment/ — durable attachment capability family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `attachment/` group provides durable image attachments: attach images to prompts and commands, and the harness saves them on your machine, shows them again in conversation history, and sends them to the model in later turns. The shipped `dsh` composition enables this with no setup. The capability and its storage are split across two packages, described below. Stored images survive restarts and are never deleted automatically, and only raster image formats are supported.

| [`attachment-local/`](attachment-local/README.md) | Stores your attached images on this machine below `DSH_HOME` | registers on `ctx.attachments` |
