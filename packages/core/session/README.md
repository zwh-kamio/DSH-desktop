English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-session` provides the append-only session log that records an agent's whole interaction history — the single source of truth every model-visible fact flows through. The LLM message history is *derived* from the log (`deriveMessages()`), never stored separately, so replay is re-derivation from the same events and compaction can shadow older surface entries without deleting history. The package also provides the in-memory store (`ctx.sessions`), the typed `SessionEvent` vocabulary that plugins extend by declaration merging, and the surface layer that orders message-producing events. Persistence is deliberately a separate concern: backends subscribe to `session/event` and flush on `session/flush`. Choose it as the foundation of any agent session; it runs no model calls itself.

## Use this package

Mount `dsh-session` wherever a session must exist. It creates and holds event-sourced `Session` instances in memory; durable storage is layered on by a persistence plugin that subscribes to the `session/event` feed.

### Create and inspect sessions

`ctx.sessions.create()` builds a live session bound to the calling fiber; `get(id)` and `list()` find sessions, and `fork()` creates a child session from a stable prefix of a live one.

```text
const session = ctx.sessions.create(sessionId, { meta: { cwd: '/workspace' } })
ctx.sessions.get(sessionId)      // the live session
ctx.sessions.list()              // every live session, in creation order
```

### Append and derive

`session.append(type, data, opts?)` commits one typed event — it snapshots and freezes the payload, validates it as lossless JSON, and notifies observers. `session.deriveMessages()` projects the log into the `Message[]` the model sees, incrementally and cached:

```text
session.append('user/message', { role: 'user', content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'hello' }], source: { kind: 'user' } },
  { surfaceOp: 'append' })
session.deriveMessages()         // the derived model history
```

Surface events (`user/message`, `assistant/message`, `tool/result`) must declare how they join the ordered surface; raw chunks, boundaries, and other log-only events never produce a message.

### Fork a session

`ctx.sessions.fork(source, boundary?, childSessionId?)` selects source events through an inclusive `boundary` seq (default: the current last event), requires the prefix to end outside an open turn, and creates a live child session with lineage metadata. A tool-time delegation that must branch mid-turn clips to a completed prefix instead.

### Flush durable state

`ctx.sessions.flush(session)` dispatches the awaited durability checkpoint: every persistence listener flushes and the call settles after all of them. A producer that needs an immediate durability barrier awaits it instead of assuming the write-behind drained.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains how the package realizes the behavior above; the observable contract is covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design concept

The package is built on event sourcing: a `Session` is an append-only log of typed `SessionEvent`s, and everything else — model history, transcripts, telemetry, titles, persistence — derives from that stream. The surface is a derived projection: an incremental manager validates append candidates, advances the ordered view from committed events, and tracks a `replaceGeneration` that bumps on every committed rewrite. Model-visible means logged: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the log. The shared [row codec](src/chunk-rows.ts) losslessly converts event sequences to compact rows and back, preserves unrecognized events verbatim, and rejects malformed rows. Persistence backends decide whether to pack writes; bounded history transports can use the same rows while retaining the complete logical interval and exact decoding for consumers that need token boundaries.

### Request headers

`request/header` stores a full canonical snapshot of the non-history request envelope with reason `initial`, `resume`, `change`, or `series`. An explicit message-series start or a surface replacement writes a `series` snapshot when the envelope is unchanged; a simultaneous change uses `startsSeries: true`. Same-series steps, retries, and ordinary later turns inherit the latest snapshot. `adapterDefaults` distinguishes values resolved by the adapter from explicit settings, and `foldRequestHeader()` selects the latest snapshot. This self-contained record supports partial-window rendering and exact reconstruction at the cost of growth per message series; the [reconstructable-requests Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-05-reconstructable-requests.md) owns the detail.

| [`src/invariant.ts`](src/invariant.ts) | Invariant companion: seq, turn/step enclosure, tool call/result pairing |

### Append validation

Every append uses the shared iterative `snapshotJsonValue()` pass, which reads, validates, and copies each nested value once, so a stateful getter cannot supply one value to validation and another to storage. Non-lossless-JSON payloads (BigInt, cycles, sparse arrays, `-0`, exotic prototypes) are rejected at the append site, before any backend flush. Surface events additionally validate marker shape, cited source-event seqs, and complete shadowed-node coverage for replacements.

### Derived history

`deriveMessages()` caches each surface node's projection once and returns a fresh array per call over shared, deep-frozen messages; each of the three surface event types (`user/message`, `assistant/message`, `tool/result`) projects its own message kind — user content verbatim, the assembled assistant message with its provider and model, or a user-role tool result. A surface rewrite rebuilds the projection — there is no raw-log fallback, so the surface is the single source of derived history.

### The request header

The loop logs a full canonical `request/header` snapshot (call config, adapter defaults, rendered system prompt, assembled tool schemas) at each loop-instance boundary and on change; `foldRequestHeader(events)` reconstructs it by selecting the latest snapshot, making every conversation request a pure function of the log. Route metadata (`request/context`) is separate logged state appended only when the provider, model, or capacity differs.

## Model Experience

### Derived message history

#### What the model sees

The model receives the complete messages from `user/message`, `assistant/message`, and `tool/result` surface entries verbatim — identities, roles, sources, and content blocks are the same values established at creation, and projections never mint identities. Direct prompts and injected context remain separate `user/message` events whose sources preserve their provenance. Chunks, boundaries, usage, and other log-only events add no message.

#### Token effect

Appended surface entries are resent on later steps. A `replace` surface operation removes the shadowed entries from future inputs without deleting their raw log records.

#### KV Cache effect

Appended surface entries preserve reusable prefixes. A `replace` operation invalidates reuse from the first shadowed message even though the underlying event log stays append-only.

### Crash-repair result

#### What the model sees

If recovery finds an assistant tool request with no durable `tool/call`, its synthetic `TOOL_NOT_STARTED` result says `The tool call was interrupted before the Harness recorded it as started. Retry it if it is still needed.` If a durable `tool/call` has no result, its `TOOL_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` result says `The tool call was interrupted after it was recorded, but no result was durably recorded. Its outcome is unknown. Decide whether to retry from the tool semantics: retry only if the operation is read-only or idempotent; if it may have side effects, first verify external state or ask the user. Do not retry blindly.`

#### Token effect

Zero tokens in an intact session. Each repaired call adds its retained risk-specific error text on resume.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Logged request header

#### What the model sees

The session reconstructs the system prompt, tool schemas, call config, and session prefix that the loop actually sent. Header events do not add a second copy to message history; the prefix is prepended outside `deriveMessages()`.

#### Token effect

Zero duplicate tokens from logging. The reconstructed prefix, system text, and schemas still incur their normal per-request cost.

#### KV Cache effect

Logging causes no invalidation, and exact reconstruction preserves request-prefix identity. A later header with changed prefix, prompt, or schemas may invalidate reuse from its first difference.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define when the session store needs special care. They are current package constraints, not a task backlog.

- **`fork()` cuts only at stable boundaries of live sessions** — the selected prefix must end outside an open turn and the source must be in the store; forking a persisted-but-unloaded session is excluded from the [fork API](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-06-30-session-store-fork-api.md).
- **`SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` stays pinned at `0`** — pre-release, no broad compatibility implied: `Session` accepts only current seed shapes, a backend refuses any other version, and unknown event types refuse reconstruction unless marked `ignorable` in the envelope ([mechanism](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-10-session-log-version-mechanism.md)).
- **`TurnEndReasonMap` omits the ACP-named `refusal` / `max_turn_requests` variants** — producer-gated: they land when an adapter or the loop first emits them.
- **No session tree beyond fork** — a pi-style entry tree over branched sessions is deferred unless a consumer needs more than boundary-based forking.
