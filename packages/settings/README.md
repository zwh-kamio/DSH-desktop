# settings/ — user-editable configuration

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `settings/` group makes plugin configuration user-editable: a plugin registers a named namespace with a schema, and users override values in one document without touching `cordis.yml`. User overrides win over the deployment's own configuration and schema defaults, and changes apply live. Two packages cover the capability: `settings/` provides the settings service, and `settings-file/` stores every namespace in one YAML or JSON document users can edit. Settings are optional: without a provider mounted, configuration stays exactly as composed.

## Packages

Two packages cover the capability; each child README owns the full contract, and the subsystem reference owns the exhaustive service surface.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`settings/`](settings/README.md) | Settings service: register namespaces and read or change their values | `ctx.settings` |
| [`settings-file/`](settings-file/README.md) | Stores settings in one local YAML/JSON file and hot-publishes external edits | registers `ctx.settings` |

- [Settings subsystem reference](../../docs/subsystems/settings.md) — namespaces, layered resolution, descriptors, change commits, and the generated cordis surface.
- [Capability seams](../../docs/capability-seams.md) — the Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer split this family follows.
