# feedback/ — recorded human feedback

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The feedback group collects human opinions about the harness's work: users can submit a free-text remark about a whole session, and rate or annotate individual assistant messages. Neither kind of feedback reaches the model — these are signals about the output, never input to it. Users record a session remark with the `/feedback` command; product surfaces read and change per-message ratings through the `messageFeedback` service. The two packages are independent: session remarks and per-message ratings do not interact. This page maps the group; the package READMEs and the [feedback subsystem page](../../docs/subsystems/feedback.md) own the per-package contracts.

## Packages

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| [`command-feedback`](command-feedback/README.md) | A `/feedback` command that records a free-text session remark with one command, without a model turn |
| [`message-feedback`](message-feedback/README.md) | Per-message ratings and notes, served to product surfaces through the `messageFeedback` service |

Session remarks are a one-way signal: recording one is safe at any point in a conversation and never changes what the model sees. With a feedback-gated sharing policy, recording a session remark is what releases the session for sharing.

Per-message ratings and notes are stored with the session, survive restarts, and never appear in model history or telemetry.
