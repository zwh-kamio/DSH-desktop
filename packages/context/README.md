# context/ — Request-context plugins

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The context group provides plugins that add model-visible context to each request without defining any tool: workspace instruction files become guidance, `@file` mentions offer path completion, other sessions can be referenced as bounded snapshots, and the model can see the current time and the agent's tmux location. All of them are opt-in except `agent-instructions`, which ships enabled in the default `dsh-agent-spine-demo` bundle and can be disabled through bundle config. Context is durable: injected instructions and references enter session history as user-role messages, so they persist, replay, and compact like other conversation content. This page maps the group; each package README owns the per-package contract.

| [`session-reference/`](session-reference/README.md) | References other sessions: mention one and its bounded read-only snapshot becomes context | `ctx.sessionReferenceResolver` |
| [`file-reference/`](file-reference/README.md) | `@file` mention discovery and the shared mention grammar for host-backed UIs | `ctx.fileReferences` |
| [`file-reference-local/`](file-reference-local/README.md) | Local-workspace completion provider for `@file` mentions | — |
| [`time-context/`](time-context/README.md) | Current time, browser zone, and elapsed time per step | — |
