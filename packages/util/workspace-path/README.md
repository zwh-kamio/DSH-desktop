## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Resolution is lexical** — it recognizes POSIX absolute paths, Windows drive paths, and UNC paths but does not access a filesystem or canonicalize `.` and `..` segments.
- **Home abbreviation is POSIX-only** — Windows paths remain unchanged because a portable browser cannot infer Windows home-path equivalence safely.
