## Summary

This package provides permission preset surfaces for two lifetimes in the Web GUI: a General-settings row chooses the default for later sessions without switching the current session. A picker on the host `/permission` command switches the current session through one flat preset list with the active value marked. Canonical built-in names render as locale-owned product labels, explicit host labels remain unchanged, and unknown kebab-case names render in title case. Choosing full access requires an explicit risk acknowledgement before either surface writes it. Both surfaces read one host-computed projection and write through one path, so the pushed projection frame is the single confirmation both follow.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside the settings and commands packages; the permission row then appears in General settings, and the `/permission` picker replaces the bare command invocation. The current-session picker is available exactly while the projection key is present; a permission-less composition shows neither picker nor Settings row.

### The picker

A pick submits the `/permission <preset>` command line. The argued path (`/permission <preset>` typed directly) still switches directly; the decoration replaces only the bare invocation. The built-in labels are `Read Only`, `Workspace Write`, and `Full access` in English and `仅可查看`, `可写入工作区`, and `完全权限` in Chinese; `custom` is display state, never a target.

### The Settings row

The row derives its options from the host's dynamic `defaultPreset` enum, uses the same localized labels as the current-session picker, and writes one settings mutation. The value applies only when a later session is created; changing it never switches or rewrites the current session.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The General row reads the explicitly exposed `permission` Settings descriptor through `ctx.settingsScope` and writes one `settings.mutate` path operation with the descriptor revision; its observable rides the slot system's `hooks` compartment, so the renderer owns React hook binding, and a push invalidation refetches the descriptor. The value is read only when a later session is created. The current-session surface is a popupSelect decoration hung on the host `/permission` command (`ctx.commandUi.decorate`): the host command keeps its slash-menu row, argued path, and durable lifecycle logging, while the decoration replaces only the bare invocation with the picker. Options and the active mark read the session's `permissions` projection — the same host-computed select the composer chip renders. The full-access option carries a `confirmation` payload the shared popup shell renders as the in-page risk gate.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the permission surface is not enough. They move from the browser surfaces to the host policy and the command shell.

- [dsh-permission-presets](../../interaction/permission-presets/README.md) — the host-side permission preset policy these surfaces write.
- [ui-commands](../ui-commands/README.md) — the popupSelect shell the `/permission` decoration registers into.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — the composer chip that renders the same permissions projection.
- [Client package map](../README.md) — adjacent browser UI packages.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the permission facts its two surfaces write: the Settings row causes a future session to start with whole-value knob events, while the `/permission` picker appends the same facts when it switches the current session; those events select the sandbox mode and approval policy later tool calls resolve.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct invalidation; the knob consumers own any request-prefix changes.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current permission surfaces. They are current package constraints, not a general policy comparison or a task backlog.

- **The Settings row is Web-only** — non-Web clients may still switch the current session through `/permission`, but do not receive this browser contribution.
- **Preset descriptions come from the host** — localized built-in labels may therefore appear beside a description written in another language.
