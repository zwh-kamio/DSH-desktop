## Summary

`dsh-client-web` boots the web GUI: it loads the client module system from the Host-provided boot graph, then activates every client plugin before the application mounts, so the full UI appears only when every plugin is up. A framework-free boot page reports per-entry status, so a failing bundle or plugin stays visible instead of a blank screen. It also defines the shared module table (`PLATFORM_MODULES`) that every dynamic bundle resolves its externals against. The model never sees this package.

## Use this package

Use it when you assemble the browser application: `apps/web`'s Vite entry runs `new AppWebEntry(container).run()` against the mount point, and the boot page carries the user through activation. Ordinary browser callers pass no options. A pre-injected page transport is the default ahead of the `seams` override: when `globalThis.__DSH_TRANSPORT__` carries `loadBundle`, the module stage adopts it as the bundle transport and skips the immediate-tier HTTP prefetch, while explicit `seams` still win (for example jsdom tests, where external `<script>` execution cannot reach the page context).

The shell base styles apply automatic CJK/Latin spacing to ordinary content in supporting browsers. Semantic code and terminal, diff, read, and search output containers retain literal source spacing and column alignment; browsers without `text-autospace` support ignore both declarations.

### What boot looks like

Boot runs in two stages: the module stage adopts the parser-loaded bootstrap batch, builds the module system from the Host-provided boot graph, and prefetches the `immediately` tier through the shared application-batch URL, which executes once. The plugin stage then activates every graph entry and waits for all of them before handing the marked boot DOM to the UI renderer, which hydrates it and switches to the complete UI.

### The boot page

The boot page uses plain DOM and local CSS, so bundle and plugin-activation failures remain visible: it shows one spinner node whose CSS arc grows as entries activate, and reports per-entry status. The spinner and its animation phase persist until the full UI replaces the boot page. A plugin that fails import or activation is reported by name with the reason (missing service, import error, or state) instead of a blank page.

### The shared module table

`PLATFORM_MODULES` (in `src/platform.ts`) names the shell-seeded shared modules — React, Cordis, and static UI libraries — and together with `PRELOADED_CLIENT_EXTERNALS` (the parser-preloaded runtime row) defines the implicit external baseline every dynamic bundle resolves against. `dsh.client.external` adds only exact non-baseline requests; see [shared modules and the module graph](../AGENTS.md#shared-modules-and-the-module-graph).

### Configuration

The package accepts no plugin config of its own; the generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md) lists every plugin config in the repo for comparison.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains how the boot kernel is built; observable behavior is covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design concept

The kernel owns exactly three things: the module system, the Cordis Loader, and the boot page. The Host owns the graph, batch preload, and loader facade, so `AppWebEntry` never knows the bootstrap package id or parses the wire format. The dynamic UI renderer receives the mount point only after every client entry activates.

### Two-stage boot

`run()` calls the Host-installed `window.__ModuleLoader__.create({ boot, staticModules, ...seams })`; the facade returns the constructed module system and parsed manifest after adopting the parser-loaded bootstrap batch. The module stage prefetches the `immediately` tier through the one shared application-batch URL. The plugin stage mounts the Loader, assigns `loader.internal = modules`, creates every graph entry uniformly, awaits quiescence, then audits activation: any entry that failed import, stayed pending on a missing service, or landed in another non-active state throws one aggregated error naming every failing entry.

### Boot page mechanics

The boot page is plain DOM with local CSS whose fallback fonts and colors match the theme tokens that arrive during loading. `internal/status` events drive one spinner node and per-entry labels; hydration preserves the node and animation phase through the application commit, and `fail()` renders the thrown reason. React mounting, slot rendering, and assembly live in `ui-renderer`; `ui-layout` owns the assembled browser-title projection.

### Source map

|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Library entry: `AppWebEntry`, `getStaticModules`, platform tables |
| [`src/boot.ts`](src/boot.ts) | `AppWebEntry`: two-stage boot, activation audit, renderer handoff |
| [`src/boot-page.ts`](src/boot-page.ts) | Framework-free boot page: spinner, per-entry status, failure rendering |
| [`src/platform.ts`](src/platform.ts) | `PLATFORM_MODULES` / `PRELOADED_CLIENT_EXTERNALS`: the implicit external baseline |
| [`src/seed.ts`](src/seed.ts) | Static module table handed to the loader at boot |

## Further Exploration

Read these when the boot contract is not enough: the module system it boots, the renderer that mounts the app, and the client authoring rules behind the baseline.

- [Client module system](../modules/README.md) — the lazy module table and boot graph this kernel consumes.
- [UI renderer](../ui-renderer/README.md) — receives the mount point and binds slot data to React.
- [Client modules subsystem](../../../docs/subsystems/client-modules.md) — the web plugin table, boot graph wire, and bundle route.
- [Client authoring rules](../AGENTS.md#shared-modules-and-the-module-graph) — the shared-module baseline and `dsh.client.external` semantics.
- [Client group map](../README.md) — the browser half this package belongs to.

## Model Experience

None, as the boot kernel is a browser-side UI plugin layer that registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define what the boot kernel does not support. They are current package constraints, not a task backlog.

- **The application waits for the full roster** — one failed entry keeps the framework-free boot page visible with a per-entry report; partial UI availability is not supported.
