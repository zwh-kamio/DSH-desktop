English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package provides the agent-preset surfaces of the Web GUI: a chip on the new-session screen choosing the next session's preset, a read-only label in the session header, and a settings section that manages the roster — copy, delete, default, and the way into a preset's own files. A session's preset is fixed at creation, so the choice applies to sessions started afterwards while running sessions keep the composition they began with; the default preset is edited in the settings section, where the roster is visible, so General settings carries no duplicate control for the same field. When a deployment composes no presets, all three surfaces render nothing and every session shares the host composition.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside the settings and conversation packages; the preset surfaces then appear where their slots render. The new-session chip opens on the deployment default and stages a pick that lands on the next blank session; the stage is spent on first use, so the following new session opens on the default again.

### Managing the roster

The settings section shows the roster as cards: a copy dialog is the only way a preset is created — the browser edits no composition text — and every custom card keeps a location action that opens the preset's own files. The default is set from any surface; deleting removes the preset directory while sessions already composed from it keep running. A shipped preset opens in a read-only viewer and offers no location or delete. A roster row carrying `broken` renders as a marked card whose body and duplication are disabled, because a copy of a broken preset is another broken preset; broken custom rows keep their location and delete actions so the files can be fixed and ghost directories cleared. The card face still shows the preset's own description — a chooser cannot act on a package specifier there — and the host's reason rides the badge as a tooltip, plus a visually hidden alert that carries it to assistive technology, which a disabled card body cannot.

### The conversational entry

When the roster carries the self-referential `cordis` preset, a dashed add-card stages it and starts a new session — the section closes the settings panel and the new-session chip's own applier composes the blank session the workspace flow produces.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The display options come from one `agentPresets/list` call — the roster already reports which id a session with no explicit choice gets, so no surface introspects the settings schema — and the default write, the settings section's make-default action, targets the `agent-presets` settings namespace's `default` field, which is what the host resolves at creation. The settings section queries `settings.canOpenAgentPresetDirectory()` when it first loads and joins that result with the roster; a failed query removes only the native-open affordance. The new-session chip and the header label share one controller, because the staged choice belongs to the flow rather than to any one session; the stage is applied when a session arrives (covering both the session a workspace connect created and the blank one it reused) and dropped on refusal. A refusal announces itself as a transient banner over the composer column, because the chip's label has already reverted and a preset the host refuses to mount is one discovery reported healthy — its roster card carries no reason to go back and read. Only a pick a person just made is announced; the applier that runs when a session becomes current is not. [`dsh-client-connection`](../connection/README.md) authenticates `agentPresets/read`, `agentPresets/copy`, `settings/openAgentPresetDirectory`, `agentPresets/deletePreset`, `agentPresets/list`, and every other Host API method with the same browser session. A composition still names the plugins a session runs, so reading one is reconnaissance, while copy, delete, and the settings-owned directory opener manage the roster and drive the host desktop. The section re-reads on its own actions, `settings/document-updated`, and `connection/reset`, because composition files are edited outside the browser and nothing on the wire announces a file change.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the preset surface is not enough. They move from the browser surfaces to the preset domain and the composition model.

- [dsh-agent-presets](../../preset/agent-presets/README.md) — the host roster and composition the surfaces read and manage.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares the hero and session-header slots the chip and label fill.
- [ui-settings](../ui-settings/README.md) — the settings shell that hosts the roster section.
- [Client package map](../README.md) — adjacent browser UI packages.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the preset a later session is composed from; the preset it selects owns every model-facing effect.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct invalidation. Changing the default never touches a running session's prefix; a session created afterwards establishes its own prefix from its own composition.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current preset surfaces. They are current package constraints, not a general composition comparison or a task backlog.

- **A preset without metadata is listed by id** — display text is optional, and a copy given no name deliberately falls back to its directory name rather than presenting itself identically to its source. The resolution itself is the shared `presetDisplayText` fold from [`dsh-agent-presets/display`](../../preset/agent-presets/README.md), which the Settings plugin list inlines over this plugin’s dictionaries to show shipped presets in the active locale without translating user-authored metadata.
- **A revealed path is display text, not a link** — where the host has no desktop opener the row shows the directory to copy by hand; the browser cannot open a host filesystem location itself.
- **Composition edits are invisible to the page** — the files are edited outside the browser and nothing on the wire announces a file change, so the roster re-reads on its own actions, `settings/changed`, and `connection/reset`, not on every disk edit.
