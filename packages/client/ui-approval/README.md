## Summary

Browser approval presentation over the Agent-scoped Remote Event waterfall. The plugin publishes each pending request through `ctx.uiSession`, takes over the Conversation composer, optionally renders correlated Tool detail, and returns the user's decision to the waiting Host request. Use it when a browser must collect approval for a waiting Host operation.

## Model Experience

None, as this package presents approval requests in the browser and registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; approval request and response rendering does not alter a model request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **The panel exposes transient decisions only** — it supports allow-once and reject; persistent permission policy remains owned by Host-side approval packages.
