# boot/ — shared app-bin boot glue

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The boot group provides what every dsh app bin needs to start: `app-boot` turns a `cordis.yml` plus your environment and patch layers into a running app with clear failure messages, and `cmdline` lets the app own its command-line flags and `--help`. With these packages you can run `dsh` or write a new application or test fixture that boots the same way. Both are libraries imported by `apps/cli` and test-only Loader fixtures, never plugins a composition loads. This page maps the group; each package README owns its per-package contract.

## Packages

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`app-boot`](app-boot/README.md) | Boots a dsh app from a `cordis.yml`: loads `.env`, applies profile and patch layers, and reports startup failures clearly | (library for the bins) |
| [`cmdline`](cmdline/README.md) | Lets the app own its flags, `--help`, and exit code; passes everything after the launcher's flags through verbatim | `cmdlineArgs`, `appExit` |
