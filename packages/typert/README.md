## Summary

With the typert group, Client environments can call Host capabilities as typed methods and share generated schemas and reflection without hand-written wire code. A build-time generator turns source type declarations into compiler-independent models and runtime artifacts, a runtime registry stores those artifacts, and a Loader integration registers them automatically in Loader compositions. A shared protocol package supplies the Remote-call declarations — decorators, wire descriptors, codecs, and provider contracts — that business packages, generated artifacts, the Host Gateway, and the Client API all consume. This page maps the four packages; each package README owns its configuration, usage, and limits.

## Packages

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`generator/`](generator/README.md) | Analyzes source types at build time and generates the reflection, schemas, and Remote descriptors that runtimes load | — |
| [`loader/`](loader/README.md) | Auto-registers generated Typert artifacts from Loader compositions into the runtime registry | consumes `ctx.loader` and `ctx.typert` |
| [`protocol/`](protocol/README.md) | Declares the Remote decorators, wire descriptors, codecs, and provider contracts shared by Host and Client | — |
| [`registry/`](registry/README.md) | Stores generated package reflection and live Zod schemas at runtime, plus lookup and Context provider registries | `ctx.typert` |
