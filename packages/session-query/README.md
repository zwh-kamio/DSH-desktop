# session-query/ — session retrieval capability family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `session-query/` group provides retrieval over live and durable session history, independent of compaction: programmatic callers query one unified service for exact logs, filtered lists, relationship traces, and full-text search; a SQLite backend powers the search; the model gets five workspace-authorized tools; and the Web UI gets an `/export` command that downloads a session ZIP. Search results agree with the conversation history the model sees. This page maps the group; each package README owns its per-package contract.

## Packages

Each package README describes what you can do with its part of the family.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`session-query/`](session-query/README.md) | Unified session-history query service: exact reads, relationship traces, and filters | `ctx.sessionQuery` |
| [`session-query-sqlite/`](session-query-sqlite/README.md) | Full-text search across session history backed by a SQLite FTS5 index | registers on `ctx.sessionQuery` |
| [`session-log-export/`](session-log-export/README.md) | Web `/export` command and browser download of a session ZIP | `ctx.sessionLogDownload` (browser) |
| [`tool-session-query/`](tool-session-query/README.md) | Model-facing tools to search, trace, and read session history | registers on `ctx.tools` |
