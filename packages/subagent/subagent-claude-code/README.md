English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-subagent-claude-code` registers a Profile-named Claude Code subagent provider (default `claude-code`) that runs a real Claude Code CLI child in the delegating session's workspace through the official Agent SDK. Each accepted run submits one self-contained text task and returns the strict final answer — or a separate safe failure diagnostic — through the shared subagent result contract. The provider ships as an optional Profile Bundle: installing it brings the pinned Agent SDK and one compatible platform CLI payload, while the registered provider stays dormant until a bound tool calls it. Native Claude settings and authentication remain authoritative, and the Profile-selected `permissionMode` decides how the unattended query handles permission checks. Choose it when the child should be a genuine Claude Code product session, fully isolated from the parent harness.

## Use this package

Mount this provider when a delegation should run as a real Claude Code session in the parent's workspace. The common path is explicit: install the Bundle into a Profile, optionally configure the provider row, and expose it to the model through a delegation tool row.

### Installing the Bundle

Install the package into the target Profile, then restart that Profile. The installation brings the pinned Agent SDK and one compatible platform CLI payload into the Profile; the declared patch layer registers only the dormant provider and starts no Claude process.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add @deepseek-ai/dsh-subagent-claude-code
dsh plugin --profile <name> remove @deepseek-ai/dsh-subagent-claude-code
dsh --profile <name>
```

Removing the package withdraws the provider and its private runtime closure on the next Profile start. Installation controls Host availability, not model permission: the model can only reach the provider through a delegation tool row you compose.

### Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `providerName` | `claude-code` | Non-empty registry name on `ctx.subagents`; each mounted instance needs a unique value |
| `model` | native Claude settings | Optional non-empty model name fixed for every run from this provider instance; omission sends no SDK override |
| `env` | `{}` | Explicit SDK/CLI environment layered over the credential-scrubbed parent environment |
| `permissionMode` | `dontAsk` | Native non-interactive permission policy fixed for every run from this provider instance |
| `disposeGraceMs` | `3000` | Grace between the shared process-tree owner's termination tiers |

| `permissionMode` value | Native behavior |
|---|---|
| `dontAsk` | Deny operations that are not already authorized instead of prompting |
| `acceptEdits` | Accept file edits; any remaining permission prompt is denied by the unattended callback |
| `auto` | Let Claude Code's native classifier allow or deny permission requests |
| `plan` | Run in native planning mode, deny execution approval, and return the completed plan as the final answer |
| `bypassPermissions` | Explicitly set the SDK's dangerous confirmation and bypass permission checks |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-subagent-claude-code) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc. A configured `model` passes unchanged to every query from that provider instance; omission leaves native model selection in force. Credential-shaped ambient variables are removed before the explicit `env` overlay, so an API key intended for the child must be supplied there. The provider omits the SDK `settingSources` option, so Claude Code reads the host's normal user, project, and local settings relative to the parent Session cwd. It does not copy or filter those files, create or modify login state, inspect `PATH`, or fall back to a host `claude` executable.

### Exposing the tool

Each delegation tool row names one provider and needs its own `toolName`, so the model sees static tools rather than a dynamic provider selector. Full Agent Presets carry a matching default tool row with `disabled: true`; copy a preset and remove that field to expose `subagent_claude_code` only to agents composed from the copy.

```yaml
- id: jobs
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-jobs-local'
- id: tool-jobs
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-jobs'
- id: tool-subagent-claude
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-subagent'
  config:
    provider: claude-code
    toolName: subagent_claude_code
    backgroundMode: one-shot
    maxDepth: provider-managed
```

The `one-shot` policy keeps omitted or `false` `run_in_background` calls in the foreground, while explicit `true` returns a parent-owned Job id for `job_output` or `job_kill`; the base host and full presets already provide the generic Job registry and controls.

### What you get

A foreground call gives the model the strict final Claude Code answer, or an error with the stop reason and optional safe diagnostic for a failed run. A background call first returns a Job id; the generic job controls later deliver a completion notice and expose the same final answer or failed status through `job_output`. Claude Code reasoning, tool activity, intermediate messages, stderr, and workspace diffs never enter the parent session.

### Failure and recovery

An install that omits optional dependencies, uses an unsupported platform, or loses the selected payload leaves the provider dormant and fails the first delegation at the SDK startup boundary with a safe `query-start` / `unknown` failure fact; there is no host-CLI fallback. The original product error stays on the internal cause chain and in the provider's Host log. A cancelled run settles as `aborted`.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains how the provider drives a real Claude Code CLI and where the observable behavior comes from; the full contract lives in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design concept

- **One fresh query per run.** Every run has an independent SDK query, cancellation controller, CLI process, and non-persisted product session; there is no continuation, resume, or pooling.
- **Native settings are authoritative.** The provider deliberately omits the SDK `settingSources` option, so Claude Code reads the host's normal user, project, and local settings; an optional `model` and the required `permissionMode` are the only query-level overrides.
- **Unattended by design.** `AskUserQuestion` is disabled and permission prompts are denied except in bypass mode, so the query never waits for a user interface.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Plugin entry: config schema, provider registration |
| [`src/run.ts`](src/run.ts) | The SDK query lifecycle, result acceptance, and permission handling |
| [`src/process.ts`](src/process.ts) | Process-tree termination escalation on disposal |
| [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) | The Profile patch layer that registers the dormant provider |

### Run flow

A start accepts only a non-empty sequence of text blocks and derives the child cwd from the parent session. It creates a private `AbortController`, calls the official SDK `query()` with the exact concatenated task, and publishes the run only after the SDK's custom-spawn hook has supplied a live CLI handle owned by the subprocess seam. The provider iterates the complete message stream and accepts only a `result` message with `subtype: "success"`, `is_error: false`, and a nonblank `result`, followed by normal iterator completion. Every other outcome maps to a fixed-category `error` diagnostic naming the lifecycle stage and observed process outcome — the category set lives in [`src/run.ts`](src/run.ts). Local cancellation wins the result race and maps to `aborted` without a failure diagnostic.

## Model Experience

### Child request

#### What the model sees

The Claude Code child receives the standalone text task as one fresh SDK query. Its workspace is the parent Session cwd; the selected Provider instance fixes the query's configured model, environment, and non-interactive permission mode, while an omitted model and every other product setting come from native Claude configuration. The executable version comes from the Bundle's pinned SDK platform payload.

#### Token effect

The child pays for an independent Claude Code context and query. Child tokens do not enter the parent's context.

#### KV Cache effect

Independent of the parent request cache. Reuse depends only on Claude Code's own model, instructions, tools, native settings, and fresh query.

### Parent scheduling and results, indirectly

#### What the model sees

Through `dsh-tool-subagent`, a foreground call gives the parent the strict final Claude Code answer or an error containing the stop reason and optional safe diagnostic for a non-completed result. That diagnostic can distinguish a coarse action category, lifecycle stage, and observed process outcome without copying raw product text or version-specific subtype names. A background call first returns a Job id; the generic job controls later deliver a completion notice, expose the same final answer or failed status detail through `job_output`, and let `job_kill` request cancellation. Claude Code reasoning, tool activity, intermediate messages, stderr, workspace diffs, usage, product ids, tool inputs, and raw protocol payloads are not copied into the parent Session.

#### Token effect

Foreground input grows by the retained final answer or error. Background input also includes the start acknowledgement, completion notice, and any `job_output`, `job_kill`, or later status results; child tokens still do not enter the parent context. This provider adds no parent tool schema by itself.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only: foreground adds one result after the reusable parent prefix, while background appends the Job acknowledgement, notice, and later control or collection results. Background scheduling can add a notice-driven turn, but none of these messages rewrites the earlier prefix.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define when this provider is a poor fit or needs special operational care. They are current package constraints, not a general Claude Code comparison or a task backlog.

- **One fresh query and process per run** — there is no continuation, resume, pooling, progress stream, or product-session persistence.
- **Static instance selection** — Profile rows fix provider names, optional models, and tool bindings; calls cannot choose or change either a provider or model dynamically, and every exposed tool needs a unique `toolName`.
- **Host settings are intentionally authoritative** — when `model` is omitted, project and user settings choose it; native settings always retain the remaining tools and behavior, and the provider does not provide a filtered or hermetic production mode.
- **Authentication and account state remain native** — the Bundle supplies the CLI but does not create an account, log in, or rewrite Claude settings; configuration and authentication failures surface with their lifecycle stage and the safe `unknown` fallback rather than a separate public classification.
- **The SDK platform payload is required at delegation time** — installs that omit optional dependencies, unsupported platforms, and missing or damaged payloads fail at the first query; there is no host-CLI fallback.
- **No human interaction path** — `AskUserQuestion` is disabled, permission prompts are denied, MCP elicitation is declined, and blocking dialogs fail closed instead of suspending.
- **Assistant payload is final text only** — reasoning, intermediate messages, tool traffic, usage, stderr, and workspace diffs remain product-local.
- **No optional shared capabilities** — `agentOptions`, output schemas, child personas, tool filtering, and harness depth enforcement are rejected by the shared service for this provider.
- **No wall-clock timeout or side-effect rollback** — the caller cancels long work, and files or external systems changed before cancellation are not restored.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

This Dev Note is working context for maintainers: open questions and undecided directions. It is explicitly non-authoritative — shipped behavior and limits live in the sections above and in the package code.

- **Payload size disclosure** — the current darwin-arm64 platform payload packs to about 92 MB and unpacks to about 325 MB; these are disclosure numbers, not installation thresholds.
- **Version-pinned protocol** — the runtime dependency is pinned to Agent SDK 0.3.241; upgrading pins a new SDK version and requires re-running the keyless real-product and loader-composition evidence.
