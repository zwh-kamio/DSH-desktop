 * Host events to reach those subscribers, but not the wire — so this double
 * implements subscription plus an explicit `emit` driver available only on the
 * concrete test object. A spec that also calls one namespace scripts it through
 * the constructor rather than reaching the real Client Remote service.
 *
 * `$mount` rejects: a spec that needs a real generated contribution installed —
 * codecs, descriptors, and the wire — has outgrown this double and needs the
 * real Client Remote service.
 *
 * One deliberate asymmetry with production: a throwing listener propagates out
 * of the emit instead of being contained and logged, so a spec cannot lean on
 * this double for the containment guarantee `$on` documents — assert that
 * against the real service.
