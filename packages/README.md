# Packages

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The harness is assembled from npm packages under `packages/`, grouped by capability family: sessions and the agent loop, model-facing tools, shell and filesystem execution, web access, subagents, and the rest. Use this page as the top-level map: find the owning group, then open its README for the package list. Every package is scoped `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` and lives in exactly one group; each group README is the authoritative package map for its family.

## Package groups

Every package lives in exactly one group; new packages join existing groups, and a new group updates its own README and this table.

## Release expectations

Most groups are product — stable API. The exceptions: `e2b/` is a POC, `experimental/` is unreleased, and `examples/`, `test-support/`, `runtime-diagnostics/`, and `util/` are support with lower compatibility expectations.

## Dependencies

The dependency graph is generated: [docs/module-graph.md](../docs/module-graph.md) (`pnpm run gen-module-graph`, freshness-gated in CI).

**Extension plugins depend on Service Definitions, never concrete providers.** `dsh-agent-loop` is swappable; UI, hook, and tool plugins use `dsh-agent`. Composition bundles, including `dsh-agent-spine-demo`, may depend on spine plugins. Capabilities separate Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer roles when they evolve independently; see [capability seams](../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-06-13-capability-seams.md).

## Package README contracts

Every package README covers purpose, configuration, extension points, and [Model Experience](../docs/cookbook/adding-a-package.md#4-write-the-package-readme) unless the model-agnostic [omission allowlist](../scripts/verify-package-readme-model-experience.ts) exempts it. It also carries `## Known Limitations and Deferred Work` or uses its [allowlist](../scripts/verify-package-readme-limitations.ts). Package conventions — exports, service access, invariants, tests — live in [packages/AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
