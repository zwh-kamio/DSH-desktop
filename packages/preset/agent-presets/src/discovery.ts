/**
 * Filesystem discovery of agent presets. A preset is a directory holding
 * {@link COMPOSITION_FILE}, optionally beside a {@link METADATA_FILE} carrying
 * its display text; the directory name is the preset id. Discovery
 * re-reads the roots on every call so a preset authored while the process is
 * running is visible without a restart.
 *
 * Discovery also owns preset HEALTH: a directory whose composition is
 * missing or unloadable is reported as a broken roster row rather than
 * skipped. A skipped directory would still occupy its id on disk — the copy
 * path refuses the name while no surface shows anything to delete — and a
 * malformed composition would otherwise read as an ordinary preset until the
 * first session fails to mount it.
 *
 * Health is what every consumer reads before offering a preset — the pickers
 * drop a broken row rather than defer the discovery to a failed session
 * start — so it covers the way an authored preset actually rots: a row naming
 * a package that was renamed or uninstalled. Resolving those names is a
 * separate pass from the shape check and stops short of importing anything,
 * so a composition is judged without running a line of plugin code.
