# Session Projections

English | [中文](session-projection.zh.md)

The session-projection seam — a [capability seam](../capability-seams.md) through which domain host plugins serve whole current values of log-derived per-session state to client carriers: the Service Definition and registry ([dsh-session-projection](../../packages/session/session-projection), `ctx.sessionProjections`), domain contributors (each registering one pure unit), and carriers ([dsh-session-controller](../../packages/api/session-controller)'s history tail page and `session/projection` push frame). It is one optional capability, not part of the agent-loop spine. The framework drives, the domain computes: the registry subscribes to `session/event` once and folds every committed event through every unit; domains hold no subscriptions and clients never fold domain events — they receive finished values. Design authority: the [session-projection RFC](../../.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-07-27-session-projection-and-command-log.md); drive/cache/feed contracts: the [package README](../../packages/session/session-projection/README.md).

## The unit

`SessionProjectionStateMap` is the merge-extensible table of host fold states, while `SessionProjectionMap` retains the client-visible whole values. A domain contributes one `ProjectionDefinition` per state key; a `wire` block makes that key client-visible, and rendering belongs to the slot system, never this layer:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One domain's state-driven computation unit: a pure synchronous fold plus
 * declarations and an optional client view — never an opaque getter. The framework drives
 * `apply` on every committed session event; the domain holds no
 * subscriptions and owns only the computation. All functions MUST be
 * synchronous (an async unit would tear the carriers' consistency cut), and
 * `state` MUST be plain JSON (the persisted-cache precondition).
 */
interface ProjectionDefinition<
  K extends keyof SessionProjectionStateMap,
  S extends SessionProjectionStateMap[K] = SessionProjectionStateMap[K],
> {
  /** The projection key this unit owns (its `SessionProjectionStateMap` entry). */
  key: K
  /** Validates persisted state before it seeds a fold. */
  stateSchema: ZodType<S>
  /**
   * State for the empty log and its immutable Session metadata.
   * @param header - immutable metadata for the Session being projected.
   * @returns the initial state.
   */
  init(header: SessionHeader): NoInfer<S>
  /**
   * Pure transition: previous state + one committed event → next state. A
   * unit uninterested in an event MUST return the same state reference — an
   * unchanged reference (`Object.is`) produces zero downstream work.
   * @param state - the state covering all prior events.
   * @param event - the next committed session event.
   * @returns the next state (same reference when the event is not the unit's).
   */
  apply(state: NoInfer<S>, event: SessionEvent): NoInfer<S>
  /** Client view. Omit for host-only units. */
  wire?: K extends keyof SessionProjectionMap ? {
    /** Validates the wire payload before it leaves the host. */
    viewSchema: ZodType<SessionProjectionMap[K]>
    /**
     * State → wire payload (the read-side projection).
     * @param state - the current state.
     * @returns the whole current value for this unit's key.
     */
    view(state: NoInfer<S>): SessionProjectionMap[K]
  } : never
  /**
   * Persisted-cache invalidation version: bump whenever the serialized state fields or the
   * fold semantics change, so persisted `(sessionId, key, ver, seq, val)`
   * rows from an older unit are discarded instead of being forward-applied
   * into garbage. Non-negative integer.
   */
  stateVersion: number
}
```

The whole-value event rule is load-bearing: a state-carrying log event carries the complete post-change state, never a bare delta — it keeps every transition trivially cheap and every served value self-describing (last-wins for consumers).

## The snapshot and the change feed

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One consistent read cut over every registered client-visible unit for one session.
 * `asOfSeq` is the shared watermark — the seq of the last event every value
 * reflects (`-1` for an empty log).
 */
interface ProjectionSnapshot {
  /** Seq of the last event the values reflect; -1 for an empty log. */
  asOfSeq: number
  /** Whole current client value per registered key. */
  values: Partial<SessionProjectionMap>
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Change-feed listener: one unit's value changed for one session. `value` is
 * the schema-validated `view` output; `seq` is the unit's watermark at
 * emission (the seq of the event that caused the change).
 */
type ProjectionChangeListener = (
  session: Session,
  key: Extract<keyof SessionProjectionMap, string>,
  value: unknown,
  seq: number,
) => void
```

`snapshot(session)` is fully synchronous: a carrier reads it in the same tick as its page slice, so `asOfSeq` covers both reads at one sequence number. It returns only client views, and every value passes its unit's `viewSchema` before return. `stateOf(session, key)` reads one live host state without computing unrelated views; callers must not mutate the borrowed reference. The change feed fires once per client-visible unit whose state *reference* changed for each committed event; `apply` must return the same reference when its state did not change.

## The registry: `ctx.sessionProjections`

`SessionProjectionRegistry` ([signatures](#ctxsessionprojections--sessionprojectionregistry)) owns the drive: one `session/event` subscription, eager `apply` over every registered unit, and per-session per-unit watermark cells. Cells build lazily — a unit registered after events flowed, or a session older than the registry, folds `init` over the in-memory log on first touch (event or read). Registration is an effect whose disposer rides the calling fiber: an unloaded domain plugin's key (with its cached cells) disappears from subsequent drives and snapshots, and clients read that as capability absence; a duplicate key with a different `stateVersion` throws, while same-version registrants share one unit and are counted. Domain plugins register under `ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'], …)` so headless assemblies without the registry stay unaffected.

### `ctx.sessionProjectionCache` — `SessionProjectionCache`

The persisted projection cache service. Opens the `session_projcache` domain at init, checkpoints live sessions on a throttled write-behind (count/interval triggers from Config) plus three mandatory points — session creation, `turn/end`, and session disposal (the live-to-cold moment) — and serves the cached rows for a session header. Every durable write is fail-soft: failures log a warning and the cache self-heals on the next write.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * The zero-I/O listing read: whole values viewed straight from the stored
 * rows (version-matching keys only), each cut carried with its watermark so
 * a client value store can seed under its higher-seq-wins rule — as stale
 * as the last durable checkpoint but never wrong, and never from an
 * unrelated log (the caller's header is the identity witness). Fresher
 * paths (the history tail baseline) supersede these values whenever a
 * session is actually opened.
 * @param meta - the listed session's header (identity witness; no log read).
 * @param keys - optional projection keys required by the caller's audience.
 * @returns the cut (`asOfSeq` = lowest served-row watermark), or
 *   `undefined` when no usable row exists for this lifecycle.
 */
cachedSnapshot( meta: SessionHeader, keys?: readonly Extract<keyof SessionProjectionMap, string>[], ): ProjectionSnapshot | undefined

/**
 * Hydrate projection cells for an already-prepared Session without another
 * persistence read. The cache seeds matching rows; the supplied exact log
 * advances every unit to the observation cut. No checkpoint is written
 * because the logical observation may contain recovery events not yet durable.
 * @param session - exact unpublished Session retained by persistence.
 * @param meta - observed lifecycle header.
 * @param events - exact logical event prefix represented by the observation.
 * @returns all projection values at the event cut.
 */
hydratePrepared( session: Session, meta: SessionHeader, events: readonly SessionEvent[], ): ProjectionSnapshot

/**
 * Durably checkpoint one live session NOW (all mandatory points call
 * this; tests and carriers may too). The registry cut is snapshotted at
 * this boundary (states are live references), then the session's record is
 * replaced on the domain's write chain. NOT fail-soft — callers on the
 * fail-soft paths contain it.
 * @param session - the live session to checkpoint.
 * @returns resolution after durability and event emission.
 */
async write(session: Session): Promise<void>

/**
 * Cold-read one session's projections from its complete log. Each unit is
 * seeded from the identity-checked cached rows — the registry skips `apply`
 * for the already-folded prefix (events at or below the row's `seq`) — and

 * the first cold read creates the cache row and later ones seed from it.
 * The caller supplies the complete log in seq order: this service never
 * consults the persistence layer.
 * @param meta - the stored session header (identity witness).
 * @param events - the session's complete log, in seq order.

### `ctx.sessionProjections` — `SessionProjectionRegistry`

`ctx.sessionProjections`: the projection unit table and its drive. The service subscribes to `session/event` once; every committed event passes every registered unit's `apply` (eager drive), and a changed state reference in a client-visible unit notifies the change feed with the schema-validated view. Cells build lazily — a unit registered after events flowed, or a session older than the registry, folds `init` over the in-memory log on first touch (event or read). Registration is an effect (disposer rides the calling fiber): an unloaded domain plugin's key disappears from snapshots and clients read it as capability absence. A host reader either declares `sessionProjections` in its plugin `inject` or fails explicitly when the registry or required key is absent. Contributors may preserve optional registration through `ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'], ...)`. Registrants sharing a key share one unit and are counted: the same tool package mounted in N agent presets registers N times, and the key survives until the last one unloads.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register one domain's unit. The registration is an effect on the calling
 * context's fiber: disposing the fiber (or calling the returned disposer)
 * removes the key — and the unit's cached cells — from subsequent drives
 * and snapshots.

 * @returns the exact disposer that unregisters this unit.
